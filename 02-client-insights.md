# Client Insights & Challenges

## Key Stakeholder Insights

### Decision-Making Structure
- **Dan (33% owner)**: Vision/design focused, understands digital importance
- **Brothers (66% owners)**: Production mindset, volume-focused
- **Result**: Constant strategy pivots, no unified direction

### Internal Resource Issues
1. No dedicated MOVO team
2. Shared resources with parent company (Sobočan)
3. Same person handles MOVO, Sobočan, and SWOODA
4. Accounting/admin mixed with marketing roles

## Communication Patterns

### Red Flags Identified
- "Go with the flow" mentality
- Pivot without sufficient testing time
- Expect immediate ROI without understanding digital timelines
- Production facility mindset applied to brand building
- "We're paying, so..." attitude

### Past Project Examples

#### Starlight Case Study
- Started as standalone brand
- 5 months of development
- 7 prototypes created
- Reverted back to MOVO collaboration
- Significant time/resource waste

## Current Performance Metrics

### Lead Generation (from Excel sheets)
- Manual tracking only
- Basic fields: Name, Email, Phone, Usage, Model, Date
- No CRM or automation
- No follow-up sequences
- Unknown conversion rates

### Website Traffic
- No analytics access provided yet
- Need to understand:
  - Traffic sources
  - Top landing pages
  - Geographic distribution
  - Search terms
  - Conversion paths

## Client Expectations vs Reality

### What They Think They Need
- "A nicer website"
- Copy competitor model
- Immediate sales increase
- E-commerce (maybe?)

### What They Actually Need
1. Clear business strategy (B2B vs B2C)
2. Working lead generation system
3. Dedicated resources
4. Realistic timelines
5. Consistent messaging
6. Professional sales process

## Working Relationship Insights

### From Previous Collaborator
- Frustration in Zagreb office and production facility
- Multiple strategy changes mid-project
- Good at paying, bad at deciding
- Need heavy guidance and structure
- Respond better to "Option A or B" than open questions

### Recommended Approach
1. Ultra-clear guardrails
2. Forced decision points
3. Proceed without them if needed
4. Document everything
5. Phase-based delivery
6. No unlimited revisions
